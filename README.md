# EE 5450 Module 1 Summative - Connect 4
Creating a Connect 4 game using kivy to create the GUI.

# Introduction

In this assignment, I attempted to create Connect4 with kivy as the library for creating the GUI.
It was a fun assignment but admittedly I did struggle a bit with trying to understand kivy.

# Files

##main.py

Creates the kivy app to run the widget.

##connect4logictest.py

Initial file used to test out the logic for the game. Game is done through command line.
No gui yet.

##connect4.py

Contains the methods used by the connect4gui file to play connect4.

##connect4.kv

Files used to describe the graphics of the gui, as well as what happens when a button is selected

##connect4gui.py
 
 Contains the kivy widget that will display the gui, that the player will use to interact with the game.
